### What I learned

Over the cours of this project I focused on building a clean, accessible and dynamic page.

Here are the key areas I develeped:

I strengthened my understanding of accessible UI design by using semanti HTML, ensuring interactive elements are keyboard-friendly and applying ARIA attributes.

I committed to writing full BEM-compliant markup and styles.

I improved how I handle states and user interactions, handling dynamic cart updates creating accesicle toggles and menus, structuring JS arrownd writing clean and maintainable logic.
